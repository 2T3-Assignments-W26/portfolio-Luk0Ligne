# Project 1
## The Cursor Game
### Short Description:
 This game was made for the programming 1 course as a final project. Essentially this game uses the arrow keys to move your character around and many other numbers are displayed around as you spawn in. 10 enemies are randomly selected and if you step over too many, the ending prompt changes.

### Tech Used:
---
The program in terms of logic and structure and doesnt use too many complexe terms due to being a first semester project. The main backbone of the game are a few arrays and the x, y postions. 

#### Code Snippet:
__To Determine the Randomized "Dangerous" Enemies:__
```
        static void SpecialEnemyDeterminer()
        {
            Int32 Counter,Arraysize,RndArrayNb;
            Arraysize = Globals.EnemyCount;
            for (Counter = 0; Counter < Globals.SpecialEnemyLimit; Counter++)
            {
                RndArrayNb = Globals.rnd.Next(0, Arraysize-1);
                Globals.SpecialEnemyXPosition[Counter] = Globals.EnemyXPosition[RndArrayNb];
                Globals.SpecialEnemyYPosition[Counter] = Globals.EnemyYPosition[RndArrayNb];
            }

        }
